## Welcome to VSI Lab! 

We are the Vision Systems and Intelligence (VSI) Laboratory at the University of Arizona. Our research explores advanced computer vision, medical image analysis, and artificial intelligence. We are particularly interested in multimodal perception and decision-making for autonomous and medical systems. We currently focus on developing lightweight, interpretable, and resource-efficient algorithms, integrating cross-disciplinary expertise in engineering and medicine to enable impactful real-world applications.
