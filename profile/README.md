## Welcome to VSI Lab! 

We are the Vision Systems and Intelligence (VSI) Laboratory at the University of Arizona. Our research explores advanced computer vision, medical image analysis, and artificial intelligence. We are particularly interested in multimodal perception and decision-making for autonomous and medical systems, focusing on developing lightweight, interpretable, and resource-efficient algorithms. By bridging engineering and medicine, we aim to enable intelligent, human-centered systems for real-world healthcare and autonomous applications.
