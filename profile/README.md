## Welcome to VSI Lab! 

We are the Vision Systems and Intelligence (VSI) Laboratory at the University of Arizona. Our research explores advanced computer vision, medical image analysis, and artificial intelligence. We are particularly interested in solving perception and decision problems for medical and autonomous systems under real-time, low-resource constraints. The lab currently focuses on lightweight and interpretable AI with cross-disciplinary expertise in engineering and medicine.
